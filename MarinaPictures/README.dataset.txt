This project provides a dataset of marina and harbour based images. The project's annotations aim to distinguish obstacles within the given environment into the following 7 classes:

- boat (sail boat, yacht, commercial/government, fishing, pleasurecraft, etc.)
- skiff (kayak, rowboat, dingy, etc.) 
- pwc / personal watercraft (jet skis, etc.)
- recreation (paddle boards, surf boards, other person powered leisure objects) 
- aircraft (seaplanes)
- mark (signs, buoys, lights, and other markers on water surface)
- debris (logs, plastic, etc.)

Annotations for object detection in this project utilize bounding boxes.
